# Rubiks Cube Solver
Bogazici University Mechanical Engineering Students Mechatronics Course Project.

We, as five mechanical engineering students, have designed and built a Rubik's Cube Solver. The objective of this project is to solve a Rubik's Cube in a fully automated manner, the steps of which can also be controlled via a joystick which makes up the interactive user interface of this project. This solver's utilizes the Kociemba library to solve the Rubik's Cube from an arbitrary starting distribution. This project involves four main steps:
1. 3D Mechanical Design --> Finding the most feasible & cost-effective solution for the mechanical body & components
2. Electrical Circuit --> Building a simple, safe & reliable electrical circuit that realizes the objective 
3. Computer Vision & Solving the Cube --> Using python to detect the colors on each face with Computer Vision, solving the cube using Kociemba library
4. Interactivity --> Utilizing a joystick that allows the user to control the progression of steps at their own pace and even reverse steps. This is accomplished using Arduino.
